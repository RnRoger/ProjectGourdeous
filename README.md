Installation;
Download the project files from Github at https://github.com/RnRoger/ProjectGourdeous.
Install the files in your desired directory. Once the files are installed you can open and edit the files in your programming API. For example Pycharm.

Inspect the files for any and all discrepancies / error’s, you may need to install additional modules in your project interpreter before you can run the project. Once you have installed all the necessary modules you should be able to run the application.

Manual;
The application is mostly web based. You can define where the application runs in the app.wsgi. Additional textmining is possible by running Textmine.py as long as you have a dedicated database defined in this module. Once you run the application you will be directed to the website gourdeous website. In this website you can interact with the front end of the application. Additional information about the web application can be found on its help page. 

Bugs; because this application interacts with pubmed you will encounter error’s if you strain pubmed or your internet connection. Make sure you have a stable internet connection or try to textmine on a time where pubmed isn’t as busy.
